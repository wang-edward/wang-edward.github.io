I used to use LunarVim a lot, but it had a big install process and I would always run into errors with different versions of neovim.
I saw some starter templates for making your own config but they all had a bunch of files (usually 10+) and a lot of code.

Then I read [this article about making a config in 1 file]([url](https://techne98.com/blog/single-file-neovim-config/)) and started working off that.

At this point I've implemented every feature (that I used) from LunarVim, and I'm on to adding more.
