Ever since I heard the tame impala live album, I wanted the Juno 106
The only thing was, it was insanely expensive, and I knew my parents would never let me get it, so I decided to make my own.

To start off, I chose the teensy 4.1 for this project because of the high price-performance ratio, and because of the teensy audio library, which makes the programming a lot easier

First, I wrote the software using the Teensy Audio Library

I used PureData to create a virtual midi instrument, which made testing a lot easier

This is the architecture

First, there are 4 oscillators, the volume of which are controlled by a mixer
They then go through the high and low pass filters, and are then modulated by the envelope.
The signal is then duplicated and sent into the flangers, and ultimately ends is output as a stereo signal that goes to the SGTL5000

There’s more complexity than this, as most of these blocks are modulated in turn by the LFO and envelope.

Once I had the software done, I started working on the hardware.
In this case, it was pretty simple, I had midi in and out, and then a bunch of sliders buttons, and leds, which you use to change parameters.

However, the teensy only has 48 pins, 12 of which are used for the audio board, 6 of which are used for power and ground, which only leaves about 30 for IO.

Additionally, I didn’t know that you could use IC’s to power multiple LED’s, such as the LM3914, so I wasted 9 pins on just LEDs.
