I started working on my new synth, which is a clone of the OP-1 this time.

To start, I was heavily inspired by Prajwal Mahesh's [Portable Synth](https://github.com/prajwal1121/Portable-Synth "Portable Synth"), as well as the [OTTO Project](https://github.com/bitfieldaudio/OTTO "OTTO Project")

I'm going to try and make updates to this post as I go, as last time it was really annoying to go back and reupdate things.

Got the MPC3000 clone working
* Had some trouble making it OOP, but it works I guess ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Got the subtractive synthesizer working. For now it's just the basic tutorial one (16 sines and 16 envelopes), but I think it'll be pretty easy to change the architecture later. I also got started ordering proof of concept parts, and GOD DAMN are SMD breakout boards expensive (Adafruit ones are ~$2.5 each but almost all others are >$7)
