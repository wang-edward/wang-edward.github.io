One prominent idea in the Unabomber manifesto is that technology has created an absence of material need, 
and our lives have been replaced by a set of meaningless "surrogate activities".

> We use the term “surrogate activity” to designate an activity that is directed toward an artificial goal  
> that people set up for themselves merely in order to have some goal to work toward, or let us say,  
> merely for the sake of the “fulfillment” that they get from pursuing the goal.

Given this definition, most things we enjoy today (art, music, games) would be considered as surrogate activities.

> Here is a rule of thumb for the identification of surrogate activities.  
> Given a person who devotes much time and energy to the pursuit of goal X, ask yourself this:  
> If he had to devote most of his time and energy to satisfying his biological needs,  
> and if that effort required him to use his physical and mental faculties in a varied and interesting way,  
> would he feel seriously deprived because he did not attain goal X?  
> If the answer is no, then the person’s pursuit of goal X is a surrogate activity.

The writer also claims that primitive humans were fulfilled through material need and thus didn't do surrogate activities.

> Many primitive peoples, when they don’t have work to do, are quite content to sit for hours at a time doing nothing at all,  
> because they are at peace with themselves and their world.  
> But most modern people must be constantly occupied or entertained, otherwise they get “bored,”  
> i.e., they get fidgety, uneasy, irritable.

The idea that primitive humans didn't entertain themselves is wrong. Primitive humans engaged in tons of art, music, and games.  

Here are some examples:

#### Bear cave painting (~30,000 BC)

#### Music

#### Natives invented lacrosse

I think this is a strong counterexample to the ideas of the power process and surrogate activities and stuff like that.

Entertainment is a fundamental part of what it means to be human, not a mindless distraction.

Also, I think this opens up a lot of further analysis refuting the author's theories. Hopefully I can expand on these in further writing.
